# Requirements #

For running the tests manually (e.g., in your dev environment), have (as in do copy if not already done) the following files from https://github.com/owncloud/administration/tree/master/ldap-testing copied into the directory "setup-scripts":

 * start.sh
 * stop.sh
 * config.php

Configure config.php according to your needs, also have a look into the LDAP and network settings in start.sh and stop.sh.

Automated test runs should work fine with the default configuration. Then the files do not need to be present (see Usage).

# Usage #

## running all tests ##

There is a script for this.

```# ./autotest.sh```

If not run from within the tests/integration directory, the script will cd into it.

If either start.sh, stop.sh or config.php are not present, the missing file will be fetched from https://github.com/owncloud/administration/tree/master/ldap-testing

## running specific tests ##

The basic command to run a single test is:

```# ./run-test.sh [phpscript]```

Yes, run it as root from within this directory.

Example:

```
$ sudo ./run-test.sh lib/IntegrationTestAccessGroupsMatchFilter.php

# How it works #

1. start.sh is executed which brings up a fresh and clean OpenLDAP in Docker.
2. The provided test script is executed. It also outputs results.
3. stop.sh is executed to shut down OpenLDAP

autotest.sh (after ensuring certain files are present) just invokes run-test.sh with specific test files. The procedure is like above. autotest.sh will stop immediately once a test fails.

# Beware #

There is no integration with any testing framework.

exceptionOnLostConnection.php is not part of this mechanism. Read its source and run it isolated. While you're at it, port it :Ã¾
