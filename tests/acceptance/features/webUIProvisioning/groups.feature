Feature: add group
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to add, delete and modify groups via the webUI
  So that I can easily manage groups when user LDAP is enabled

  Background:
    Given user admin has logged in using the webUI
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page

  Scenario: Adding a simple database group should be possible
    When the administrator adds group "simple-group" using the webUI
    Then the group name "simple-group" should be listed on the webUI
    And group "simple-group" should exist

  Scenario: Add group with same name as existing ldap group
    When the administrator adds group "grp1" using the webUI
    Then a notification should be displayed on the webUI with the text "Error creating group: Group already exists."
    And the group name "grp1" should be listed on the webUI

  Scenario: Add ldap group with same name as existing database group
    Given group "db-group" has been created in the database user backend
    When the administrator imports this ldif data:
      """
      dn: cn=db-group,ou=TestGroups,dc=owncloud,dc=com
      cn: db-group
      gidnumber: 4700
      objectclass: top
      objectclass: posixGroup
      """
    And the administrator reloads the users page
    Then the group name "db-group_2" should be listed on the webUI
    And group "db-group_2" should exist

  Scenario: delete group
    Given group "simple group" has been created in the database user backend
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page
    When the administrator deletes the group named "simple group" using the webUI and confirms the deletion using the webUI
    Then the group name "simple group" should not be listed on the webUI
    When the administrator reloads the users page
    Then the group name "simple group" should not be listed on the webUI
    And group "simple group" should not exist

  Scenario: delete ldap defined group
    When the administrator deletes the group named "grp1" using the webUI and confirms the deletion using the webUI
    Then dialog should be displayed on the webUI
    | title                       | content                     |
    | Unable to delete grp1       | Unable to delete group.     |
    And group "grp1" should exist

  Scenario: Adding database user to database group should be possible
    Given user "db-user" has been created with default attributes in the database user backend
    And group "db-group" has been created in the database user backend
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page
    When the administrator adds user "db-user" to group "db-group" using the webUI
    Then user "db-user" should exist
    And user "db-user" should belong to group "db-group"
