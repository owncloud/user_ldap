Feature: add group
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to add, delete and modify groups via the command line
  So that I can easily manage groups when user LDAP is enabled

  Background:
    # In drone the ldap groups have not synced yet. So this occ command is required to sync them.
    Given the administrator has invoked occ command "group:list"
    And this user has been created using the occ command:
      | username | displayname  |
      | Alice    | Alice Hansen |


  Scenario Outline: admin creates a group
    When the administrator creates group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    And the command output should contain the text 'Created group "<group_id>"'
    And group "<group_id>" should exist
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                     |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here        |
      | España      | special European characters |
      | नेपाली      | Unicode group name          |


  Scenario Outline: admin removes a user from a group
    When the administrator creates group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    When the administrator adds user "Alice" to group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    When the administrator removes user "Alice" from group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    And the command output should contain the text 'Member "Alice" removed from group "<group_id>"'
    And user "Alice" should not belong to group "<group_id>"
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                     |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here        |
      | España      | special European characters |
      | नेपाली      | Unicode group name          |
