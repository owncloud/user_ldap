Feature: login users

  As an admin
  I want users to login with their email address stored on a LDAP server
  So that they only need to remember one username and password (SSO)

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: login with default settings
    When the LDAP users have been resynced
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: using ldap filter including email field
    When LDAP config "LDAPTestId" has these settings:
      | key                | value                                                                            |
      | ldapLoginFilter    | (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(\|(uid=%uid)(mailPrimaryAddress=%uid)(mail=%uid))) |
      | ldapEmailAttribute |                                                                                  |
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: using ldapEmailAttribute but loginFilter lacks email field
    When LDAP config "LDAPTestId" has these settings:
      | key                | value                                    |
      | ldapLoginFilter    | (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=%uid)) |
      | ldapEmailAttribute | mail                                     |
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: no ldapEmailAttribute and loginFilter lacks email field
    When LDAP config "LDAPTestId" has these settings:
      | key                | value                                    |
      | ldapLoginFilter    | (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=%uid)) |
      | ldapEmailAttribute |                                          |
    And the LDAP users have been resynced
    Then it should not be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: change Email address on LDAP server
    When the administrator sets the ldap attribute "mail" of the entry "uid=Alice,ou=TestUsers" to "Alice-change@example.org"
    And the LDAP users have been resynced
    #need a sync here because the automatic sync only happens after login
    #so after changing the email address one last login is possible with the old address
    Then it should not be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI
    But it should be possible to login with the username "Alice-change@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: change Email address on LDAP server, do not sync
    When the administrator sets the ldap attribute "mail" of the entry "uid=Alice,ou=TestUsers" to "Alice-change@example.org"
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "Alice-change@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: add a second Email address
    When the administrator adds "Alice-change@example.org" to the ldap attribute "mail" of the entry "uid=Alice,ou=TestUsers"
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI
    When the user logs out of the webUI
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "Alice-change@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI


  Scenario: delete the Email address
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When the administrator sets the ldap attribute "mail" of the entry "uid=Alice,ou=TestUsers" to ""
    And the LDAP users have been resynced
    Then it should not be possible to login with the username "alice@example.org" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI
    But it should be possible to login with the username "Alice" and password "%regular%" using the WebUI
    When the user logs out of the webUI
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "brian@example.org" and password "%alt1%" using the WebUI

  @skipOnOcV10.2
  Scenario: login with a new user
    When the administrator imports this ldif data:
      """
      dn: uid=newuser,ou=TestUsers,dc=owncloud,dc=com

      cn: newuser
      sn: newuser
      displayname: New User
      gecos: newuser
      gidnumber: 5000
      givenname: New User
      homedirectory: /home/openldap/newuser
      loginshell: /bin/bash
      mail: newuser@example.org
      objectclass: posixAccount
      objectclass: inetOrgPerson
      uid: newuser
      uidnumber: 50005
      userpassword: NewPwd123456
      """
    Then it should be possible to login with the username "newuser@example.org" and password "NewPwd123456" using the WebUI
