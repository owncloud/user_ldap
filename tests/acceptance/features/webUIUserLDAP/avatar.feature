Feature: providing an avatar by LDAP - check CI

As an user
I want to see my avatar from LDAP being used in owncloud
So that other users can recognize me by my picture

	@skip @issue-198 #we cannot revert this even with deleting the user
	Scenario: upload an avatar to the LDAP server
		When the admin sets the ldap attribute "jpegPhoto" of the entry "uid=user2,ou=TestUsers" to the content of the file "testavatar.jpg"
		And the user browses to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "user2" and password "1234" using the webUI
		Then the display name should not be visible on the WebUI
		And an avatar should be shown for the current user on the WebUI

	Scenario: set the avatar on the LDAP server to an invalid string
		When the admin sets the ldap attribute "jpegPhoto" of the entry "uid=user2,ou=TestUsers" to "0"
		And the user browses to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "user2" and password "1234" using the webUI
		Then the display name should be visible on the WebUI
		And "User Two" should be shown as the name of the current user on the WebUI
		And no avatar should be shown for the current user on the WebUI
